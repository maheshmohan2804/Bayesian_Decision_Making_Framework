# Which Day to Promote? Hypothesis Testing using Bayesian Decision Framework
This is a Applied Bayesian Statistics class project where I apply the principles of bayesian statistics to help identify the best weekday to roll out promotions based on the data from a Ecuadorian superstore./n
You can find the report for this project which explains in detail the methodology of the decision making framework. There are two Notebooks which have the hypothesis testing and bayesian time series forecasting done using PyMC3 and PyBATS respectively.
